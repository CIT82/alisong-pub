2. i want to replace the images used in the website with more relevant photos
3. i want to change the styling, colors, fonts.
4. i want to change the format of the header so that it is more of a solid bar instead of being transparent.
5. i want to edit the content in the testimony and turn it into a 5-star review
6. i want to remove the testimony and extra lorem ipsum from the menu page. i want to edit the styling of the menu so it looks more like a real menu instead of a fake one. 
7. i want to edit the hover dropdown for the gallery button so that it is more stylized.
8. i want to add actual pages for the links in the dropdown menu because they currently link to nowhere.
9. I want to remove the contact section from the header and keep it only in the footer or on the reservation page so that i don't have so much clogging up the header
10. i want to change the testimony and random content on the reservation page so it is more relevant to making reservations
11. i want to change the flow of the reservation page so the form and the text are next to each other instead of having space between
12. i want to connect actual links to the footer buttons and social media icons
13. i want to add different and more content to the graph on the about page
14. i want to move the columns that the header paragraph is in for the menu so that the paragraph can sit more centered. 
15. i want to change up the design of the recipes that are in the bottom of the home page, and give them their own page.
